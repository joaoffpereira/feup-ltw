#Project notes
In order to be able to share polls on the supported social networks, a user must be using [paginas.fe.up.pt](http://paginas.fe.up.pt) and not [gnomo.fe.up.pt](http://gnomo.fe.up.pt), else, say Facebook, will not authorize the share post.
Just follow [this link](http://www.fe.up.pt/~ei12079/pollhub) and everything should work just fine.
